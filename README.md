One Page Theme Switcher
-----------------------

Personal website (created with a persistent theme switcher just for fun.)  
Inspired by the popularity of linktree (and others like it) which provides a quick link hub to other destinations. 

### Created with:
- React (...but probably could have went pure HTML)
- Typescript (...just because)
- HTML (...obviously)
- CSS (...can be magical)
- Firebase Firestore (...serverless is ðŸ”¥)

### Todo
- [ ] Unit Tests
- [ ] 100% Coverage
- [x] CI / CD (because ssh'ing is tiresome)
