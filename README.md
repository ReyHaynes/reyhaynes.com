One Page Theme Switcher
-----------------------

Personal website created with theme switcher just for fun. Inspired by the popularity of linktree (and others like it) which provides a quick link hub to other destinations. 

### Created with:
- React (...but probably could have went pure HTML)
- Typescript (...just because)
- HTML (...obviously)
- CSS (...can be magical)
